# ult-texas-holdem-monte-carlo
A monte carlo simulation for checking the expected value of Ultimate Texas Holdem gameplay strategies

While writing this code I heavily referenced https://github.com/petrosDemetrakopoulos/TexasHoldemMonteCarloSimulation
in order to understand how to approach the code and https://wizardofodds.com/games/ultimate-texas-hold-em/ for a
baseline strategy to follow.

# Envonronment and Setup
A reminder on how to use venv:

python -m venv monte-carlo # set up a venv if you haven't created it yet

source monte-carlo/bin/activate # to activate the venv for this code
